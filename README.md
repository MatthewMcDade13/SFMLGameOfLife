# SFMLGameOfLife
Conway's Game of Life made with C++ and SFML

This was made for learning purposes. This is my first project using SFML

and using multithreading in general, so a lot of code is me experimenting.

### Controls for game:

+ E: Toggle ability to add or remove cells on mouse click
+ P: Pause game
+ R: Randomize all cells
+ C: Clear all cells
+ <- Decrease generation speed
+ -> Increase generation speed
